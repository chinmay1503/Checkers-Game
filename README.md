# Checkers-Game

<b> A simple single-player checkers game created using Pythonâ€™s pygame module which can be played against a computer AI whose calculations are based on the minimax algorithm. It also shows the specific moves the AI algorithm is considering to figure out the best move through simulations.
The intention of this project was to implement and understand the working of Minimax Algorithm. <b>

<h3> How it Works? and What's Minimax Algorithm? </h3>

<b> Minimax is a backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. It is widely used in two player turn-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, etc. </b>
